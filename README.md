Web scrapping using Python &amp; Flask

In this Project, I have done web scrapping in python (using flask)

Web scraping refers to the extraction of data from a website. This information is collected and then exported into a format that is more useful for the user. Be it a spreadsheet or an API.

All the installing that are required is given in the requirements.txt file.

This is just a simple version. You can play around with the code for executing other things.

PS: Give your own password & username for creating a MongoDB database.
